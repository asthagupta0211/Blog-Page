    <summary>Machine Learning Basics</summary>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions on new data. It is used in various applications like image recognition, speech processing, language translation, recommender systems, etc. In this article, we will see more about ML and its core concepts</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Python for Machine Learning</summary>
    <p>Python language is widely used in Machine Learning because it provides libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. These libraries offer tools and functions essential for data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models. It is well-known for its readability and offers platform independence. These all things make it the perfect language of choice for Machine Learning.</p>

    <summary>Feature Engineering</summary>
    <p>Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, creating or modifying features like input variables or data to help machine learning models learn patterns more effectively. It involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve model accuracy and performance.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Supervised Learning</summary>
    <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labelled data—meaning every input has a corresponding correct output. The model makes predictions and compares them with the true outputs, adjusting itself to reduce errors and improve accuracy over time. The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. </p>

    <summary>Model Evaluation and Tuning</summary>
    <p>When building machine learning models, it’s important to understand how well they perform. Evaluation metrics help us to measure the effectiveness of our models. Whether we are solving a classification problem, predicting continuous values or clustering data, selecting the right evaluation metric allows us to assess how well the model meets our goals. In this article, we will see commonly used evaluation metrics and discuss how to choose the right metric for our model.</p>
